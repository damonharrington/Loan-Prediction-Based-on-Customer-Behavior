# Loan-Prediction-Based-on-Customer-Behavior
Loan Prediction Based on Customer Behavior using PySpark

# Description:
This repository demonstrates the use of PySpark for predicting loan approvals based on customer behavior and historical data. The project leverages the distributed computing capabilities of PySpark to efficiently preprocess large datasets and train machine learning models, making it ideal for handling large-scale financial data.

# Features:
Big Data Processing: Uses PySpark for scalable data manipulation and preprocessing.
Feature Engineering: Extracts and transforms features from customer behavior data, such as credit score, income, and loan history.
Model Training: Implements machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, or Gradient Boosting within the PySpark MLlib framework.
Evaluation: Assesses model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC.
Scalability: Demonstrates how to work with large datasets and distributed systems for real-world applications.
